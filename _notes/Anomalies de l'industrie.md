Je dois faire plus de recherches sur ces initiatives.

### [Newvelle Records](https://www.newvelle-records.com/)
>Each year Newvelle records and releases six records exclusively on vinyl and with curated artwork and literature. The Newvelle model treats musicians right and uses the full available canvas of vinyl to make a unique and beautiful box set.

### [Catalytic Sound](https://catalyticsound.com/)
>Catalytic Sound is a music based co-operative designed to help create economic sustainability for its artists through patron support.  Put simply, 50% of the money you spend at Catalytic Sound will always go directly to the musicians.

### [Over Everything](https://overeverything.org/)
>We are a non-profit label and artist empowerment organization. Our mission is to help push the industry towards more fair and equitable practices by supplying free music industry education, and offering development & release support to independent artists we believe in. _“Art Over Everything // Purpose Over Profit”_

### [MUSICat](https://musicat.co/)
>MUSICat empowers any library to collect, share, and support local music. Affordably priced for libraries serving populations of all sizes, MUSICat provides music streams and optional downloads to library users and gives librarians and musicians an extensive digital toolkit for building a collection together.

Plusieurs bibliothèques utilisent MUSICat pour fournir des collections de musique locale à leurs abonnés. J'aimerais trouver le temps pour voir si une initiative similaire serait possible à Québec.

Au Canada : [Capital City Records - Edmonton, AB](https://capitalcityrecords.ca/)

>With the library, we built Capital City Records, a digital public space to celebrate Edmonton's local music scene and its history. Capital City Records also includes a growing collection of additional contemporary and historical materials, from a poster collection to a documentary series that features local venues. Capital City Records launched in September 2015 and is an ever-evolving vibrant digital public space celebrating Edmonton musicians.
